# Elevate Labs Task 6 â€“ Strong Password Creation & Evaluation

## Task Overview
The objective of this task was to create multiple passwords of varying complexity, test their strength using online tools, and learn best practices for secure password creation.

## What I Did
- Created several passwords with different lengths, character sets, and complexity.
- Used an online password strength checker (passwordmeter.com) to evaluate each password.
- Noted scores, time to crack estimates, and feedback for improvement.
- Identified patterns that make passwords strong or weak.
- Researched common password attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.

## Key Learning
- Strong passwords include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Password length significantly increases resistance to brute-force attacks.
- Avoid common words, predictable patterns, and personal information.
- Multi-factor authentication adds another critical layer of security.
